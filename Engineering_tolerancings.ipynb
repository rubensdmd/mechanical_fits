        "<p align=\"justify\">A solid is defined by its surface boundaries. Designers typically specify a component’s nominal dimensions such that it fulfills its requirements. In reality, components cannot be made repeatedly to nominal dimensions due to surface irregularities and intrinsic surface roughness. Some variability in dimensions must be allowed to ensure that manufacture is possible. However, the variability permitted must not be so great that the performance of the assembled parts is impaired. The allowed variability on the individual component dimensions is called the tolerance.</p>"
